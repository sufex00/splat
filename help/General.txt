What is Splat?

Splat is a tool intended to find plagiarized papers. These papers
can be provided by the user, or the websearch can be used to 
download papers from the web that match given specifications. Once
a search and comparison is completed, a new window will pop up with
the results.


Getting Started

When splat starts up, you are given a set of tabs that run various
combinations of searches and/or comparisons. Choose any of these. Select
Help from the menu for more information.


Important Notes:

Before Splat can operate properly, you must set appropriate third party 
converters in the data/options.cfg. Follow the directions given in that 
file. The default is set to the unix ps2ascii utility which operates correctly
in some cases, but has been found to be problematic in others. Check that this
utility is producing conversions as expected.
