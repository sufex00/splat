HTMLFrame shows the result of a comparison computation on a set of documents. There are lots of features in an HTMLFrame.

Main window area:

On the left are all the interesting comparisons (ones where there was a non-zero similarity between two documents). These are listed in the form [A,B] n%. This means that document B has n% content that is "identical" (as defined by the algorithm used to compare A and B) to content in A.

In the center there are two large windows. These show highlighted copies of the contents of the two documents in the current comparison (the one that is selected from the list on the left). The highlighted areas are those designated by the comparison algorithm for whatever reason (usually the cheated sections). 

At the bottom there is a log panel that shows messages about what the user has selected or the window has done.
